                  <p>Our evaluation doesnâ€™t just determine what level of care you need. It also allows us to choose what therapeutic options could be part of your treatment program.</p><br />
                    <p>You will remain awake during these short, non-convulsive, non-invasive procedures. They should not hurt, although some patients may have mild headaches or scalp discomfort. TMS does not cause memory loss, and your magnetic field exposure throughout the course of the treatment, which is less than you would receive from an MRI, is minimal.</p>
