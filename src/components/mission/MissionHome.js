          If youâ€™re struggling to treat symptoms caused by complex mental health or behavioral health issues such as depression, anxiety, or PTSD, it may be time to try something different. TMS may be the next step in your journey towards healing for those who have not found adequate relief from therapy or prescription medications alone.
